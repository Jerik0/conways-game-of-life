# conways-game-of-life

I have no prior knowledge of Python other than some udemy lessons about basic syntax for strings and logic.

This is my first attempt at coding in python, and my first attempt at coding conway's game of life. I thought this would be a great challenge for myself, to test and sharpen my developer skills.

If you're looking at this little repo, hello and please don't judge me. :)

I fully intend on adding to this until I'm satisfied with the work, though looking at my repos in the past I don't know how well that will go. Still, I am very excited about this so hopefully it comes along.

CONWAYS GAME OF LIFE RULES:

Birth: A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes alive in the next generation
Death by isolation: A live cell with one or fewer live neighbors dies in the next generation
Death by overcrowding: A live cell with four or more live neighbors dies in the next generation
Survival: A live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation
